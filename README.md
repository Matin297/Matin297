I'm dedicated to perpetual learning and honing my coding skills. I try to read open source repositories to learn from or contribute to.

I'm on the lookout for opportunities where I can leverage my expertise and passion for coding.

Currently, I enjoy tackling code challenges on platforms like Leetcode to sharpen my problem-solving skills and stay engaged with the community.
